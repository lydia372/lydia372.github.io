Hi! I'm **Liu Yichuan** 👋, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Business Analytics at the National University of Singapore (NUS). 

I'm passionate about building **AI-driven tools** and **data-powered systems** that solve real-world problems — especially at the intersection of **technology 💻, finance 💰, and human decision-making 🧠**.

Over the past year, I've developed **autonomous trading agents**, **simulation models for social influence**, and **academic platforms** that help students manage coursework more efficiently. I enjoy working on projects that combine **machine learning, behavioral insights, and interactive visualizations** .
