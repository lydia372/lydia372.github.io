Hi! I'm **Liu Yichuan** 👋, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Business Analytics at the National University of Singapore (NUS). 

I'm passionate about building **AI-driven tools** 🤖 and **data-powered systems** 📈 that solve real-world problems — especially at the intersection of **technology 💻, finance 💰, and human decision-making 🧠**.

Over the past year, I've developed **autonomous trading agents** 💹, **simulation models for social influence** 🌐, and **academic platforms** 🧑‍🏫 that help students manage coursework more efficiently. I enjoy working on projects that combine **machine learning 🤖, behavioral insights 🔍, and interactive visualizations **.
