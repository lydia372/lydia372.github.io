Designed and developed a unified academic tracking platform using Vue.js and Firebase to consolidate disparate learning tools into a seamless, centralized dashboard.

### Social Influence Optimization via Graph Neural Networks 

Developed a simulation of voter behavior on a social graph to evaluate political influence strategies. Built an undirected graph from shared hobbies and modeled daily vote propagation until stabilization. Simulated interventions—such as targeted influencers and hobby-based tactics—to assess impact on voting outcomes. Applied spectral graph theory (Laplacian eigen-decomposition, L^k) to identify the most structurally influential nodes, informing optimal influence strategies based on network topology.
