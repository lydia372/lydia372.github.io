Hi! I'm **Liu Yichuan**, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Business Analytics at the National University of Singapore (NUS). I'm passionate about building AI-driven tools and data-powered systems that solve real-world problems — especially at the intersection of **technology, finance, and human decision-making**.

Over the past year, I've developed autonomous trading agents, simulation models for social influence, and academic platforms that help students manage coursework more efficiently. I enjoy working on projects that combine **machine learning, behavioral insights, and interactive visualizations**.
